Purpose:
Takes an input file(1st arg) and makes a adjacency list representation of it, 
then figures out pathings using BFSand places it in an output file(2nd arg) 

to use run $ make\n
then use $ ./FindPath (inputfile) (outputfile)\n

Included important Files:
List.h                      header file for doubly linked list functions
List.c                      source file for List.h
Graph.h                     header file for adjeacency graph
Graph.c                     source file for Graph.h
GraphTest.c                 Ensures Graph.c/h Working as intended
FindPath.c                  main source code for this projects Purpose(above)
Makefile                    make it easier to compile nessecary files
README                      Serve as a TOC of sorts for files
