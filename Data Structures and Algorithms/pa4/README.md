Purpose:
Takes an input file(1st arg) with 2 matricies and computes other 
matricies using the 2 original then places them in an out file(2nd arg).

to use run $ make\n
then use $ ./sparse (inputfile) (outputfile)\n

Included important Files:
List.h                      header file for doubly linked list functions
List.c                      source file for List.h
Matrix.h                    header file for adjeacency graph
Matrix.c                    source file for Matrix.h
MatrixTest.c                Ensures Matrix.c/h Working as intended
ListTest.c                  Ensures List.c/h Working as intended
Sparse.c                    main source code for this projects Purpose(above)
Makefile                    make it easier to compile nessecary files
README                      Serve as a TOC of sorts for files
