What did you do in this lab?:
I tested and midly adjusted code in order to make a program to put numbers in order. I also used printf to print numbers enough to have a good handle on the function now.

What mistakes did you make, and how did you identify and solve 
them?:
I spent about 6 hours trying to figure out how to fix the rounding error but no matter how hard I tried it was always 0.000001 off but I identified the issues with the printf statement and I attempted to solve it with the help menu and general information on the internet on float,double, and long double data types.

Do you have any feedback for us about this lab?:
In 3.c.iv it says left hand side should have 3 padding zeros(which is either my misintrepetation, confusing wording, or just wrong, either way  I thought I would note this) but the example image dosent show that as well as the example image area not saying close enough values are ok to use which caused me to use too many hours on this lab. Also in the future I think Lab0 should just be getting the software working and then some test files to make sure everything works b4 assigning this assignemnt work as its put many students at different places in the class and has caused mass panic. Especially because of many procrastinators who thought this would be as simple as using python on google collab notebooks which I know a lot of people did. Lastly videos really help for setting this stuff up.
