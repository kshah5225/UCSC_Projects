NO EC, We got the Cheating EC working in theory but ran out of time as you can see by the deadline and didnt transfer it over to these functions.

***Overview:***
This project is amazing for culmunating all of our skills into one big project. Namely the I/O, State Machines, Event Driven, and Display. We also have Teamwork as an aspect as we have to test many things both together and seperatly and hold each other accountable for getting the right items done on time. The largest problems we ran into is getting all of our files to work together without random errors with such a short time-span.

***What worked well? What didnâ€™t? Describe at least one testing strategy you found effective:***
We found working on one set of files at a time helped a lot. and the professor's message functions were more robust so we used the so we could printf for debugging. Where this hurt us is we wasted 2 hours trying to figure out why our messages was casuing crashes untill we relized it was from our debugging printfs. Also we noticed the arrow in the professors code didn't switch sides.

***What did you learn from this lab?***
When working in teams we need to allocate more time for integration struggles as we spent few hours getting it to work on either side but many hours debugging the few errors that occured Overall this lab took approx 24 hours and I needed more time

***What did you like about this lab? What would you change
about this lab?***
I liked that the professor started us out with working .o files for us to swap in and out as it helped us learn how they work and how to use them without having to go into labs to ask TA's who mostly didnt have answers.
