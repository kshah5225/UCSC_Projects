Description:use MML in order to create a left shift calculator that can write, read, and left shift in accordance to instructions found here:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JSeD1uPM0VqKF-q_2K984IZnLeevTTnK/edit#
Included files: Lab2.lgi, Lab2subtraction.lgi, left shift test.lgi
Instructions: Open Lab2.lgi using Multimedia Logic(aka. MMLogic or MML)(which you can find here:http://www.softronix.com/logic.html)
Once opened you can add numbers using binary to select the registrar and then the keypad to select the number you would like to use. Lastly click update button to make that number show in one of the registrars where 
you can then select which numbers you would like to preform the shift in using the binary read switches and your reasult will be seen in the bottom rightmost display. Lab2subtraction works much the same way except 
it will subtract instead of left shift. Lastly the left shift test file is simpily a development file where I tested the last page in lab_2 isolated from everything else in order to ensure my logic wasent flawed.
