##### Personal Experience in Python:
I have been able to program in python proficiently since junior year of Highschool which is 4 years ago. I have done a couple of personal AI/Machine Learning/Botting personal projects outside of my formal education at ucsc and High School. I enjoy the language as it is quick and easy though it is inconvenient having one class in c and python at the same time.

##### Project 1 Experience:
This lab took approximately 5 hours and it was mostly in part due to not understanding how to add the motor sensor and read the other sensor values. We also were unsure how we should be using the state machine as I feel like it doesn't make sense in the context of this project because it only has the same state once and at the end of that state it goes onto a different state both times so while I understand the point of the state matching in general I do not see the use in this project so we just implemented the state machine as appropriately as we could.

##### Project 1 Group Experience:
I had no issues with my groupmate as we set a time to sit down together and get everything done and we worked together effeciently to get everything done.
