**Summary:**
This lab was great in terms of getting an introduction to dealing with files using C. It also helps reinforce how to handle lots of data and many different types of data. Getting the file picking system working was definitly the easiest part and while I had some trouble at first trying to intake binary data I soon learned that interpreting most data as int or char fixed most problems I was having when before I was trying to intake strings and couldnt get the number of chars to read correctly.

**Approach:**
In this case because I was so lost on how the file management worked I skimmed the manuel and then got to work figureing out how to do the file management. Once I had the basics of reading files figured out I did a more through read through and I was able to start making all of the functions and I made a helper function to load all the appropriate data into so I only had to open a file once per user input across all these different functions. In the end this worked very well. the only major problem was when I spent an hour trying to figure out why my strings wouldnt compare when the actual issue was I wasent returning SUCCESS in the loadfile helper function. Otherwise everything went relativly smoothly.

**Conclusion:**
In the end the Lab came out perfectly. I believe this lab took me about 12 hours of time to complete. I liked the ability to code the way I wanted for the mostpart in this lab. I would have some testcases created for the students in the future if possible as well as making the rubric a bit more descriptive and precise. Especially for the makefile section of the rubric and maybe have some help for the makefile stuff because 3 of the TA's didnt even know what the documentation wanted or how to do it. The Lab section helped massivly with the file opening and closing portions.
